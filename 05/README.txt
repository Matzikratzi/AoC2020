Hi, this was an emacs solution! :)
(but I also made a python solution)

query-replace F to 0
query-replace B to 1
query-replace L to 0
query-replace R to 1
M-x sort-lines

Last line, convert to decimal from binary
(M-x calculator RET B <insert value> D

First answer what is left in calculator

Second assignment:
C-M-s .........1C-qC-j.........1

or
C-M-s .........0C-qC-j.........0

One answer to that. What is the value in between?
convert to decimal as before.
